            On <strong>December 20th, 2025</strong>, the day before embarkation, we invite you to join us for a land celebration here in New Orleans.
            If you are unable to attend the cruise, but would still like to celebrate with us, we would love to have you attend (you can also get a weekend trip to New Orleans out of it).
          </p> 
          <p>
            The event will be held at <a href="https://www.fourthwallnola.com/">Fourth Wall</a> from <strong>6pm - 10pm</strong>.  Food and drink will be provided.
            Come as you are. 
          </p>
          <p>
            We would like to have as many people as possible attend, but unfortunately we need to have a headcount known in advance.
            We ask that you please let us know if you plan to come by <strong>November 1st</strong> by texting either <strong>Nathan - <a href="tel:+19144712411">(914) 471-2411</a></strong> or <strong>Makki - <a href="tel:+19729719208">(972) 971-9208</a></strong> directly.
            Please let us know of any dietary restrictions as well.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <strong>What should I wear?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Wear whatever you want! Keep in mind we will be taking lots of pictures so wear something you don't mind seeing photos of yourself in later. If you like a theme, we're going with ocean/all shades of blue but there's no obligation to participate.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Where should I stay?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We are not doing a hotel bloc, but there are many excellent hotel options near the venue. Most everything downtown is within reasonable walking distance of both Fourth Wall and the port to board the cruise ship. The Hilton Riverside has a catwalk directly to where the cruise boards, and may be a good option for cruise-goers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Do you have a gift registry?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not have a registry, but if you would like to give us a gift we would be delighted if you would help support PBS with a small donation in our honor. Please visit <a href="https://www.pbs.org/about/about-pbs/support-pbs/">this link</a> if you would like to contribute!

New Orleans is typically in the low to mid 60s in December, but it is not unheard of for it to get down to the 40s so keep that in mind whenever you pack.</p>
